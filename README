To generate the HTML files of the common mannkendall docs from the source,
type the following in a terminal:

cd <mannkendall path>
sh build_docs.sh

This will create all the pages in a new build folder.

To actually generate a new version of the docs in order to push it to Github, one should first fetch
the current docs, and only then re-generate the latest version.

In other words:

# Clone the source files
git clone --single-branch --branch master https://github.com/mannkendall/mannkendall.github.io.git

# Move into it
cd master

# Clone the current published docs in a "build" directory
git clone --single-branch --branch gh-pages https://github.com/mannkendall/mannkendall.github.io.git build

# Generate the new docs by overwritting files
# Note: does this actually "delete" old files as well ?
sh build_docs.sh

# Go into the newly build docs and push it live
cd build
git add -A .
git commit -a -m "Update docs"
git push origin gh-pages
