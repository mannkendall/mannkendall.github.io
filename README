To generate the HTML files of the common mannkendall docs from the source,
type the following in a terminal:

cd <mannkendall path>
sh build_docs.sh

This will create all the pages in a new build folder.

To actually generate a new version of the docs in order to push it to Github, one should first fetch
the current docs, and only then re-generate the latest version.

In other words:

git clone https://github.com/mannkendall/mannkendall.github.io.git build

sh build_docs.sh

cd build

git add -A .
git commit -a -m "Update docs"
git push origin gh-pages
