mannkendall
===========

Welcome to the documentation of the mannkendall code.
The code was initially written in matlab, and subsequently ported to R and Python. All three
versions have dedicated documentation pages describing their respective installation and use. For a
high level, language-agnostic, description of the code, look at the
:ref:`about:Spirit of mannkendall`.

All three implementations of the code were first released in late 2020, alongside their dedicated
scientific article (`Collaud Coen et al., 2020 <http://...>`). At the time, all three
implementations were designed to be perfectly consistent with one another in their functionalities.

.. note::
    Maintaining consistency between the different implementations will happen on a best-effort
    basis, and cannot be guaranteed in the long term. However, any deviation from one of the
    implementations with respect to the others will be clearly documented.

    **Current compatibility status: full**
