mannkendall
===========

Welcome to the documentation of the mannkendall code.
The code was initially written in Matlab, and subsequently ported to R and Python. All three
versions have dedicated documentation pages describing their respective installation and use. For a
high level, language-agnostic, description of the code, look at the
:ref:`about:Spirit of mannkendall`.

All three implementations of the code were first released in late 2020, alongside their dedicated
scientific article (`Collaud Coen et al., 2020 <https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-2020-178>`__). At the
time, all three implementations were designed to be perfectly consistent with one another in their
functionalities.

.. note::
    Maintaining consistency between the different implementations will happen on a best-effort
    basis, and cannot be guaranteed in the long term. However, any deviation from one of the
    implementations with respect to the others will be clearly documented.

    **Current compatibility status: full**

.. note::
    This code was written specifically to implement the prescriptions of Collaud Coen et al. (2020).
    But there are other public codes implementing Mann-Kendall functionalities out there, including:

        * `pymannkendall <https://github.com/mmhs013/pymannkendall>`__
